      <h1>Peering Into Closed Societies</h1>
      <h2>The AP-NORC Center explores public opinion Cuba.</h2>
      <p>Countries like Cuba, with tight restrictions on the movement of people and information, are difficult to study and understand. In the fall of 2016, NORC conducted a survey that offered a rare glimpse inside the daily lives of Cuban citizens, revealing insights into their attitudes, and the goals they aspire to for themselves and their country. According to survey results, most Cubans believe a normalization of diplomatic relations with the United States will be a positive change for Cuba. They are hopeful it will lead to expanded economic opportunities and a greater ability to visit the United States. The survey also reveals that Cubans want to see fundamental changes to their economy, with a majority saying there should be more private enterprise, and many with a personal goal of owning their own business. Additionally, fully 95 percent prioritize a high level of economic growth as an important goal for the country, and more than two-thirds view competition in the marketplace as a positive force for this growth.</p>
