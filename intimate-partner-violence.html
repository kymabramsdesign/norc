      <h1>Combating Intimate Partner Violence</h1>
      <h2>NORC informs and evaluates anti-violence initiatives</h2>
      <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men aged 18 and older have been the victim of severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime. In addition to death and injuries, intimate partner violence has been linked to a host of other adverse health and social outcomes. For several years now, NORC has been helping policymakers, healthcare and social service providers, educators, and law enforcement officials better understand and develop programs meant to prevent intimate partner violence.</p>
      <p>Nearly five decades of research has suggested there’s a strong association between exhibiting violent behavior and being a victim of violence. NORC and the University of Iowa have launched the nationally representative <strong>Interpersonal Conflict and Resolution (iCOR) study</strong>. Funded by the National Institute of Justice, iCOR will examine how the nature of interpersonal conflict and individual conflict management styles influence the overlap between victimization and perpetration. Unique to this study, iCOR researchers are comparing longitudinal patterns of conflict and resolution across different relationship contexts to understand the differences and similarities for offenders and victims within intimate partnerships, friendships, and interactions with strangers.</p>
      <p><strong>Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA)</strong>, an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, offers affordable healthcare and other services to millions of Americans who are geographically isolated, economically or medically vulnerable. NORC is working with HRSA to develop and implement a strategy for addressing intimate partner violence through HRSA’s programs, policies and activities. NORC is also working with HRSA’s <strong>Office on Women’s Health</strong> to evaluate the performance of five health systems approaches to enhancing health care provider training, screening, treatment, and referrals for needed social services for patients who have been victimized, through the Intimate Partner Violence Provider Network project.</p>
      <p>In 2013, with NIJ funding NORC launched the National <strong>Survey on Teen Relationships and Intimate Violence (STRiV)</strong>, the first comprehensive national survey of teen dating violence in the US to combine data from both young people and their parents or caregivers. Using STRiV data across six annual surveys as teens age into young adulthood, NORC researchers are assessing patterns in aggressive and violence relationship behaviors over time, investigating the nature and impact of varying relationship dynamics, and analyzing disparities associated with adolescent relationship aggression in vulnerable populations.</p>
