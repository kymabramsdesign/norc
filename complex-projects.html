      <h1>Assessing the Impact of Complex Projects</h1>
      <h2>NORC’s expertise allows evaluation of multi-pronged development projects.</h2>
      <p>Driven by a need to get the most from their development investments and a growing recognition that health, education, economic, and civil society issues are often deeply intertwined, governments and NGOs have increasingly pursued multi-tiered initiatives that attempt to improve the well-being of vulnerable populations from more than one direction. To parse that complexity and assess the impact of those programs, they often turn to NORC. We are collaborating with the World Education Initiative to evaluate Tanzania’s Waache Waste (Kiswahili for “let them learn”) project, which uses a “Whole of Girl” approach to address the multiple factors—from the threat of school related gender-based violence, to the socioeconomic stability of families, to reproductive health—that often hinder girls education.</p>
      <p>In Uganda, NORC is evaluating programs sponsored by Literacy Achievement and Retention Activity that are meant to improve student retention, participation, and reading ability by training teachers. The programs have also introduced new curriculum and materials that stress early grade reading and promote a safer learning environment through non-violent classroom management, positive discipline, and preventing, responding to, and reporting school-related gender-based violence.</p>
