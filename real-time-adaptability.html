      <h1>Adapting Timelines and Methodologies to Conditions on the Ground</h1>
      <h2>NORC researchers respond to dynamic project situations.</h2>
      <p>Assessing international development projects presents many novel challenges, from logistics and language to political uncertainty and civil unrest to the very complexity of the projects being examined. NORC prides itself on being able to adapt its methodologies and project timelines to serve the needs of its clients and demands of collecting scientifically rigorous data. To reliably estimate the impact of a new bridge on traffic patterns in Côte d’Ivoire, NORC had to carefully time its midline traffic surveys between the completion of nearby road repairs and the closing of the old bridge. Using innovative statistical modeling that used data from three different types of traffic surveys, NORC was able to estimate the impacts of the new bridge on traffic patterns, time savings, and vehicle operating costs.</p>

      <p>In Bangladesh, NORC is evaluating the impact of a barge container terminal developed by the logistics company Summit Alliance Ports Limited with the support of the Dutch development bank FMO, and we evaluated two major port renovations in Benin and Cape Verde that focus on both infrastructural upgrades and institutional management. Over the next few years, NORC will assess the projects’ influence on a complex array of factors, including the quality and price of transportation, the reduction of road congestion and pollution, and the improvement of working conditions environmental practices among the terminal’s clients, partners and competitors.</p>
