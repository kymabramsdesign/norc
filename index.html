        <p>How do the circumstances of childhood and adolescence influence career and earnings outcomes? What attributes promote resilience in communities faced with entrenched poverty or natural disaster? How do congregations function as economic entities? NORC researchers are adept at identifying, measuring, and drawing insight from a complex web of socio-economic indicators—from weekly surveys of the price of gas to longitudinal studies of the intersection between childhood circumstance and professional success—and provide reliable, unbiased data that inform important family, business, and government decisions.</p>

          <p>Can data-mining identify predictors of student achievement or warnings of student struggle? Does parent coaching and education improve early childhood success? Is personal mentoring an effective way of keeping college students on track for graduation? From assessing the nation’s supply and demand for early care in education to tracking the educational and career arcs of doctoral students, NORC researchers have been helping policymakers and education providers improve education access and effectiveness throughout the learning lifecycle.</p>

          <p>Can text messages help children learn to read? Can voter education reduce political corruption? What are the most effective ways to measure the prevalence and impact of human trafficking? Leveraging experience in more than 70 countries around the world, NORC helps government agencies, NGOs, and stakeholders of all kinds to maximize the effectiveness of their global development efforts. NORC’s country- and subject-matter expertise, cultural sensitivity, and innovative, adaptive data-collection methods have made us a sought after partner. And increasingly, we are becoming the all-inclusive in-country resource for program design, implementation, and evaluation in countries like Senegal, El Salvador, and Tanzania.</p>

          <p>What are the most effective and innovative ways of structuring and paying for health-care services?  How can care best be delivered to those covered by Medicare and Medicaid? Can data in electronic health records help identify patients at risk of hospital-acquired infections? Can geospatial mapping help predict outbreaks of mosquito-borne illnesses? How do peoples’ attitudes about health and health care influence their choice of providers and care settings? Since conducting the National Study on Family Medical Costs and Voluntary Insurance in 1953, NORC has studied and informed ongoing changes in the programs that serve vulnerable populations and how Americans provide and pay for health care. NORC’s capacity has grown along with those changes to include an expanding array of clients and partners and increasingly diverse methods of rigorous data collection and analysis.</p>

          <p>How are Americans preparing for aging and retirement? What can social media tell us about the effectiveness of local tobacco regulation? How does political affiliation influence media consumption, and vice versa? Since probing American attitudes towards rationing during the Second World War, NORC has provided politicians, policymakers, and scholars with a clear and unbiased perspective on American social and cultural attitudes and behavior. The foundation of this work is the General Social Survey, which NORC has conducted since 1972. Its branches include explorations of issues as diverse as traffic safety and arts participation.</p>
